# Tennis analysis

To analyze data from the Tennis VR environment, collect all the data files (`.csv`) and place them in a folder.
If you want to compare data from different experimental conditions (e.g., experts versus beginners), create two separate folders.
The folder for each condition should only have the csv files from that condition and no sub folders.

In case only a single condition is examined, place all `.csv` files in a single folder.
